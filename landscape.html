                    The Cliffs of Moher are sea cliffs located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland. 
                    They run for about 14 kilometres (9 miles). 
                    At their southern end, they rise 120 metres (390 ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head, and, 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north, they reach their maximum height of 214 metres (702 ft) just north of O'Brien's Tower, a round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs, built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien, then continue at lower heights. 
                    The closest settlements are the villages of Liscannor 6 km (4 miles) to the south, and Doolin 7 km (4 miles) to the north.
                    From the cliffs, and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. 
                    The cliffs rank among the most visited tourist sites in Ireland, with around 1.5 million visits per year.
                    The cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped a list of attractions in 2006 by receiving almost one million visitors at the official visitor centre. 
                    With additional visitors to other locales included there are around 1.5 million a year. 
                    Since 2011, they have formed a part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, one of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network and also recognized by UNESCO. 
                    The cliffs are also a "signature point" on the official Wild Atlantic Way tourist trail.
                    While the cliffs can be accessed at multiple points, and there is an 18 kilometres (11 miles) Cliff Walk, the majority of visitors come to the official visitor centre.

                    The Giant's Causeway is an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption.
                    It is located in County Antrim on the north coast of Northern Ireland, about three miles (5 km) northeast of the town of Bushmills.
                    It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 and a national nature reserve by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland in 1987. 
                    In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, the Giant's Causeway was named the fourth-greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom.
                    The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot and disappear under the sea. 
                    Most of the columns are hexagonal, although some have four, five, seven or eight sides. 
                    The tallest are about 12 metres (39 ft) high, and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres (92 ft) thick in places.
                    Much of the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast World Heritage Site is owned and managed by the National Trust. 
                    It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving over 998,000 visitors in 2019. 
                    Access to the Giant's Causeway is free of charge: it is not necessary to go via the visitor centre, which charges a fee. 
                    The cliffs are also a "signature point" on the official Wild Atlantic Way tourist trail.

                    The Wild Atlantic Way is a tourism trail on the west coast, and on parts of the north and south coasts, of Ireland. 
                    The 2,500 km (1,553 mile) driving route passes through nine counties and three provinces, stretching from County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula in Ulster to Kinsale, County Cork, in Munster, on the Celtic Sea coast.
                    The route is broken down into five sections:
