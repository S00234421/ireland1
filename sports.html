                <h2>Hurling</h2>
                <p>
                    Hurling is an outdoor team game of ancient Gaelic Irish origin, played by men. 
                    One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, the number of players and much terminology. 
                    The same game played by women is called camogie , which shares a common Gaelic root.
                    The objective of the game is for players to use an ash wood stick called a hurley (in Irish a camán to hit a small ball called a sliotar between the opponent's goalposts either over the crossbar for one point or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for three points. 
                    The sliotar can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air or struck on the ground with the hurley. 
                    It can be kicked, or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass), for short-range passing. A player who wants to carry the ball for more than four steps has to bounce or balance the sliotar on the end of the stick, and the ball can only be handled twice while in the player’s possession.
                    Provided that a player has at least one foot on the ground, he may make a shoulder-to-shoulder charge on an opponent who is in possession of the ball or is playing the ball, or when both players are moving in the direction of the ball.
                    No protective padding is worn by players. 
                    A plastic protective helmet with a faceguard is mandatory for all age groups as of 2010. The game has been described as "a bastion of humility", with player names absent from jerseys and a player's number decided by his position on the field.[1]

                <h2>Gaelic Football</h2>
                <p>
                    Gaelic football, commonly known as simply Gaelic, GAA or Football is an Irish team sport. 
                    It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. 
                    The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goals (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goals and over a crossbar 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) above the ground (1 point).
                    Players advance the football up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking the ball upward into the hands). 
                    In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. 
                    A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. 
                    A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net (the ball cannot be hand-passed into the goal), signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. 
                    Positions in Gaelic football are similar to those in other football codes, and comprise one goalkeeper, six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.
                    Gaelic football is one of four sports  controlled by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the largest sporting organisation in Ireland. 
                    Along with hurling and camogie, Gaelic football is one of the few remaining strictly amateur sports in the world, with players, coaches, and managers prohibited from receiving any form of payment. 
                    Gaelic football is mainly played on the island of Ireland, although units of the Association exist in Great Britain, mainland Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

                <h2>Rugby</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ireland national rugby union team is the men's representative national team for the island of Ireland in rugby union. 
                    The team represents both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
                    Ireland competes in the annual Six Nations Championship and in the Rugby World Cup. 
                    Ireland is one of the four unions that make up the British & Irish Lions – players eligible to play for Ireland are also eligible for the Lions.
                    The Ireland national team dates to 1875, when it played its first international match against England. 
                    Ireland reached number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in 2019. 
                    Eleven former Ireland players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.  
                    The traditional home of Irish rugby is Lansdowne Road in Dublin, where most of Ireland's home matches were held. 
                    The stadium was rebuilt between 2007 and 2010. 
                    Naming rights were sold to an insurance company, and the venue is now referred to as the Aviva Stadium.
                    The original stadium, owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union, was built in 1872, and so the venue continues to hold the distinction as the oldest still in use for international rugby. 
                    In 1878 the ground hosted its first rugby Test, with Ireland playing host to the English (the first representative rugby match had taken place prior to the Test, a game between Ulster and Leinster). 
                    Lansdowne Road had a capacity of just over 49,000 before it was demolished in summer 2007. 
                    The redeveloped stadium seats 51,700 and was opened in May 2010. 
                    The final Irish Test prior to work commencing on the remodelled stadium was against the Pacific Islanders in late 2006.

                <p>
                    The Republic of Ireland national football teamrepresents the Republic of Ireland in men's international football. 
                    It is governed by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).
                    The team made their debut at the 1924 Summer Olympics, reaching the quarter-finals. 
                    Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the Irish Free State and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as Éire or Ireland. 
                    During the same period, another Ireland team also existed; this was overseen by the Irish Football Association (IFA) and had previously been the sole national team for the entire island of Ireland. 
                    In 1953, FIFA decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams could enter, the FAI team would be officially called Republic of Ireland while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland. 
                    Northern Ireland was allowed to keep using the title Ireland by FIFA in the British Home Championship (which was discontinued in 1984). 
                    The Republic of Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to defeat England at home, in a fixture played at Goodison Park, Liverpool, in 1949. 
                    The team reached the quarter-final stage of the 1964 European Nations' Cup, where they lost to the eventual champions Spain.
                    Under the guidance of Jack Charlton, the team enjoyed their most successful era, reaching their highest FIFA world ranking ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 in their first appearance at the UEFA European Championship, reaching the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the 1994 edition.
